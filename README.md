# Recipe-For-Disaster

This is a website dedicated to cooking featuring mostly recipes written in Ruby on Rails I have written in my spare time. My native language is Java but I have recently started teaching myself Ruby on Rails since June 2016. I prefer this language much more than Node.js and Jade which I used for an earlier assignment this year. This was written in the text editor Atom using Windows 10 64-bit Ruby 2.2.4 and Rails 4.2.5.1.

Currently users are able to create accounts and post their own recipes. Additionally, they may alter or delete their publishings. Users and visitors alike are able to access all recipes posted to the website using either browse, new arrivals or even the search bar which is case insenstive. Currently there are no comments yet and personally I believe nothing is complex enough to justify commenting at this level. Ruby on Rails is quite straight forward and user friendly so I hope my code is readable. This is an extension to http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
